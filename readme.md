<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Go to nodejs.org/download and install node.js for your computer</li>
	<li>Click `Download Zip` in the corner of this page, and save the zip file on your desktop</li>
	<li>Unzip the zip file</li>
	<li>Open the file called `essay.html` in a text editor</li>
	<li>Copy and paste your essay as directed
		<ul>
			<li>in between `<div class="essay">` and `</div>`</li>
			<li>place `<p>` at the start of every paragraph and `</p>` at the end of every paragraph. Be sure to leave a space between `</p>` and the end of your sentence! (I could probably fix this, but I am too busy/lazy at the moment)</li>
			<li>Replace all `'` in your paper with `&#39;`. If any other weird things show up in your print preview, use [this](http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm) chart to fix them.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Open `Command Prompt` (Windows) or `Terminal` (Mac/Linux)</li>
	<li>Run the following command: `cd Desktop/number-essay`</li>
	<li>Run this command too: `npm install`</li>
	<li>Then this command: `node withpipes.js`
		<ul>
			<li>You should get a happy message in the terminal telling you that everything worked. If not, you have broken everything and there is no hope of (not really)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Open the file `pipedessay.html` in your web browser of choice (but chrome or firefox are the only acceptable choices (for life, not this specifically))</li>
	<li>Print and Enjoy! (Don't forget to write your last name and page number in the corner. I fix one problem to create another, because that's how I role.)</li>
	<li>If you have made it this far without failure, you are now an html/node/commandline master!</li>
<ol>

<p>I made a few changes to make the final text easier to read, but I have yet to hear back from Decker if it's enough or not. If you can actually get this code to work (It's not very user-friendly, sorry), you may risk a lower grade in exasperating her with your crazy essay, unless I fix the formatting later. :)</p>
